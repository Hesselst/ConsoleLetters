# ConsoleLetters
A basic console application made in C++. Only works with the letters A and B so far. This one of my first projects in C++ and i see some optimizations i can make like combining some functions, i might fix those later but i have to focus on some other projects atm. I also used quite some if-statements, so if anyone has feedback on how i couldve done it easier please let me know (;
# Compatibility
Only tested on windows

As you can see, it only works with A&B as of now, if you put any other letters in it will return a question mark
